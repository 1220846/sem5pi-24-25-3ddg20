# US 5.1.3 - Add new types of operations

## 1. Context

*In this task it was proposed that a Admin can add new types of operations.*

## 2. Requirements

**US 5.1.20** As an Admin, I want to add new types of operations, so that I can reflect the available medical procedures in the system.

 - Admins can add new operation types with attributes like:
    - Operation Name
    - Required Staff by Specialization
    - Estimated Duration
 - The system validates that the operation name is unique.
 - The system logs the creation of new operation types and makes them available for scheduling
immediately.
