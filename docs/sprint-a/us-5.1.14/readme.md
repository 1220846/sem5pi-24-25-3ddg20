## 1. Content

*In this task it was proposed that an Admin can deactivate a staff profile*

## 2. Requirement

**US 5.1.14** As an Admin, I want to deactivate a staff profile, so that I can remove them from the hospitalâ€™s active roster without losing their historical data.

- Admins can search for and select a staff profile to deactivate.
- Deactivating a staff profile removes them from the active roster, but their historical data (e.g.,
appointments) remains accessible.
- The system confirms deactivation and records the action for audit purposes.
